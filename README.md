# Decoupler-MVU

Decoupler-MVU is a legacy-proof approach to developing user interfaces, based on the principle of decoupling the business logic from the view, utilizing the Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture that was introduced by [Elm language](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). This approach makes UI code more scalable, testable, and less prone to becoming legacy.

[Decoupler-MVU was introduced in the following articles.](https://dev.to/kino6052/series/23800)

## Overview

In today's era of dynamic UI development, codebases tend to become convoluted as they scale, making UI development legacy-prone. The tight coupling of the view layer with the rest of the application has been identified as the primary cause of this problem. Most of the prevalent architectural patterns and frameworks such as MVC, MVP, MVVM, and even Redux fall short in solving this issue effectively, especially for large-scale projects.

Decoupler-MVU proposes a better approach for UI development to address these challenges. It leverages the Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture to separate the view from the business logic. This makes UIs easy to change and test, offering a viable solution to the problem of code becoming legacy.

The repository comprises a series of articles that reflect on the reasons behind the susceptibility of UI code to becoming legacy and propose a comprehensive approach to overcome it. For detailed insights, visit the original article [here](https://dev.to/kino6052/series/23800).

## Why Decoupler-MVU?

- **Testability and Scalability**: The separation of business logic from view enables easier testing of both these complex parts of applications separately, enhancing the testability and scalability of UI code.
- **Quick Feedback**: This approach simplifies the process of obtaining quick correctness feedback in a black-box manner.
- **Adaptability**: It allows for easy and swift adaptation to changing requirements, reducing the chances of code becoming obsolete.
- **Legacy-Proof**: By offering quick feedback and promoting good patterns, it helps to prevent the code from becoming legacy.
